This album was the last album of the Beatles as a whole band. It consists of Beatles' most famous pieces such as 'Come Together', 'Something' and 'Here comes the Sun' that have been linked to Classic Rock'n'Roll music through the years. 

It also contains more experimental and eccentric songs like 'You never give me your money' or 'Maxwells silver hammer' that show a different and less mainstream image of the Beatles at that time. 

Many foreign influences can be notices that give to an album a more unique touch. Lastly the final song:'The End' summarizes the album in the most rewarding way by combibing the different sounds and best parts that the listenedr has enjoyed.
